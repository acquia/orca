# Example GitHub Actions configuration.
#
# This configuration file will cover ORCA integration for most packages almost
# without modification. Use as follows:
#
# 1. Copy this file to your package root:
#
#    $ cp example/.github/workflows/orca.yml ../my_package/.github/workflows/orca.yml
#
# 2. Change the values in jobs.build.env for your package. No other changes are
#    strictly necessary for a basic integration.
#
# 3. Review the other comments in the file for additional configuration options.
#
# 4. Strip the (now unnecessary) comments:
#
#    $ sed -i'.bak' -e '/^[[:blank:]]*#/d;s/#.*//' orca.yml && rm orca.yml.bak
#
# For advanced needs,
# @see https://github.com/acquia/orca/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md
#
# For all GitHub Actions build config options,
# @see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
