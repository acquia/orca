# Example Travis CI configuration.
#
# This configuration file will cover ORCA integration for most packages almost
# without modification. Use as follows:
#
# 1. Copy this file to your package root:
#
#    $ cp example/.travis.yml ../my_package/.travis.yml
#
# 2. Change the values in env.global for your package. No other changes are
#    strictly necessary for a basic integration.
#
# 3. Review the other comments in the file for additional configuration options.
#
# 4. Strip the (now unnecessary) comments:
#
#    $ sed -i '' '/^[[:blank:]]*#/d;s/#.*//' .travis.yml
#
# For advanced needs,
