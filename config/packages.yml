# An array of company software package data. Each package datum is keyed by its
# package name, i.e., the "name" property in its composer.json file, e.g.,
# "drupal/example", and has a corresponding array value that may contain the
# following key-value pairs:
# - "type": (optional) The package type, corresponding to the "type" property in
#   its composer.json file. The most common types are these:
#   - "drupal-module": A Drupal module. (default)
#   - "drupal-theme": A Drupal theme.
#   - "drupal-profile": A Drupal installation profile.
#   - "drupal-drush": Drush commands.
#   - "drupal-library": A Drupal library.
#   - "project-template": A Composer project template.
#   - "library": Anything else installed in the "vendor" directory.
# - "install_path": (optional) The path the package gets installed at relative
#   to the fixture root, e.g., docroot/modules/contrib/example.
#   Used internally for Drupal subextensions. Defaults by "type" to match the
#   "installer-paths" patterns specified by the root Composer project.
# - "url": (optional) The path, absolute or relative to the root of a local
#   clone of the package. Used for the "url" property of the Composer path
#   repository used to symlink the system under test (SUT) into place. Defaults
#   to a directory adjacent to the fixture root named the Composer project name,
#   e.g., "../example" for a "drupal/example" project.
# - "version": (optional) The recommended package version to require via
#   Composer. Defaults to "*". Any version string Composer understands is
#   acceptable. @see https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md A null
#   value (~) causes the package to be omitted.
# - "version_dev": (optional) The dev package version to require via Composer.
#   Defaults to "*@dev". Any version string Composer understands is acceptable.
#   @see https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md A null value (~)
#   causes the package to be omitted.
# - "core_matrix": (optional) An array of package version mappings. Each mapping
#   is keyed by a Drupal core version constraint, e.g., "8.7.x", with a value of
#   an associative array optionally containing either or both of the "version"
#   and "version_dev" key-value pairs to be used when the corresponding Drupal
#   core version constraint is satisfied. Mappings are processed in order, and
#   the first match wins.
#   @see \Acquia\Orca\Tests\Fixture\PackageTest::testConditionalVersions
# - "enable": Whether to enable the extension in Drupal. Defaults to true for
#   modules but can be overridden. Anything else is always false and cannot be
#   overridden.
#
# These are converted to \Acquia\Orca\Fixture\Package objects by
# \Acquia\Orca\Fixture\PackageManager. A different specification can be
# substituted at runtime using the "ORCA_PACKAGES_CONFIG" environment variable
# or merged in using the "ORCA_PACKAGES_CONFIG_ALTER" environment variable. See
# config/services.yml for the relevant code or bin/self-test for a usage
# example.
