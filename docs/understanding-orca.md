## The basics

ORCA is a [Symfony Console](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html) application. It requires PHP, Composer, SQLite (which it uses to avoid a MySQL requirement on the host), and Git. It expects to be installed in a directory adjacent to the [system under test (SUT)](glossary.md#sut). It creates its [test fixtures](glossary.md#test-fixture) under the same parent, e.g.:

 ```
 .
 └── Projects
     ├── example     # The system under test (SUT)
     ├── orca        # ORCA itself
     └── orca-build  # The test fixture
 ```

## Test fixtures

An ORCA test fixture is comprised of a [BLT](glossary.md#blt) project with one or all Acquia software packages (as specified in [`config/packages.yml`](../config/packages.yml)) added via Composer. There are two basic kinds:

* A **standard fixture** includes and installs the SUT as well as all other Acquia packages.
* A **SUT-only fixture** includes and installs the SUT and omits all other non-required Acquia packages.

Packages are included at one of two levels of stability:

* Their **recommended, stable** versions.
* Their **development** (dev/HEAD) versions.

ORCA uses [path repositories](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path) to make Composer install the system under test (SUT) from the local directory. Merely composing the test fixtures can reveal many quality and interoperability issues.

## Static analysis

ORCA checks the SUT for low level construction defects using the following static analysis tools:

* [Composer validate](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#validate) checks `composer.json` files for validity and completeness.
* [Composer normalize](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize) checks `composer.json` files for consistent ordering and formatting.
* [PHP Parallel Lint](https://github.com/JakubOnderka/PHP-Parallel-Lint) checks PHP files for syntax errors.
* [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) detects coding standards violations using the following rulesets:
    * [Drupal Code Sniffer](https://packagist.org/packages/drupal/coder) encapsulates [Drupal coding standards](https://www.drupal.org/coding-standards ) and best practices for module development.
    * [PHPCompatibility](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility) checks for PHP cross-version compatibility with all supported language versions.
    * [phpcs-security-audit](https://packagist.org/packages/pheromone/phpcs-security-audit) finds vulnerabilities and weaknesses related to security in PHP code.
* [PHP Mess Detector](https://phpmd.org/) looks for potential problems in PHP source code, such as possible bugs, suboptimal code, overcomplicated expressions, and unused parameters, methods, and properties.
* The [Symfony YAML Linter](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml.html) checks YAML files for syntax errors.

Static analysis requires no special setup of the SUT.

## Automated tests

ORCA tests for functional and behavioral correctness with [PHPUnit](glossary.md#phpunit) and [Behat](glossary.md#behat).

* An **integrated test** tests the SUT in the _presence_ of all other Acquia packages (i.e., in a standard fixture) to ensure that all packages can be added to the same codebase via Composer (preventing dependency conflicts), that there are no install time or functional conflicts between them, and prevents regressions.
* An **isolated test** tests the SUT in the _absence_ of other non-required packages (i.e., in a SUT-only fixture) to ensure that it has no undeclared dependencies on other packages and functions correctly on its own.

## Continuous integration

ORCA includes out-of-the-box support for Travis CI for continuous integration. The default implementation runs the following concurrent jobs per build:

| | Static code<br /> analysis | Deprecated<br /> code scan<br /> w/ SUT | Deprecated<br /> code scan w/<br /> dependencies | Integrated/<br /> recommended | Isolated/<br /> recommended | Integrated/<br /> dev | Isolated/<br /> dev |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Fixture type | None | SUT-only | SUT-only | SUT-only | SUT-only | Standard | Standard |
| Package stability | n/a | Stable | Stable | Stable | Stable | Dev | Dev |
| Static analysis | :black_circle: | :white_circle: | :white_circle: | :white_circle: | :white_circle: | :white_circle: | :white_circle: |
